# ghc-podbean-helper

A simple tool for easily managing Grace Harbor's audio via the Podbean API

## Special Thanks

For the people who helped provide inspiration along the way:

- Thanks to @10xLaCroixDrinker, who created the public [bible-reference-validator](https://github.com/10xLaCroixDrinker/bible-reference-validator) package. Much of the inspiration for this repository's local `BibleReferenceValidator` came from there, and the `bibleData.json` started off as a direct copy! The `BibleReferenceValidator` would've taken me much longer if the ground work wasn't already done!
